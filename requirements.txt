# ADP Demo Requirements
# This demo uses only Python standard library modules, so no external dependencies are required.
# However, specifying Python version for deployment compatibility.

# No external packages needed - the demo uses only:
# - json (standard library)
# - time (standard library) 
# - uuid (standard library)
# - random (standard library)
# - datetime (standard library)
# - typing (standard library)
# - dataclasses (standard library, Python 3.7+)
# - enum (standard library)
# - threading (standard library)
# - asyncio (standard library)
# - http.server (standard library)
# - urllib.parse (standard library)
# - sys (standard library)

# If you need to add any external dependencies later, uncomment and modify:
# requests>=2.28.0
# aiohttp>=3.8.0
# fastapi>=0.95.0
# uvicorn>=0.20.0
